## Data sources

This analysis used Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) between calendar years 2015 and 2022. 
  
## Requirements

R scripts were written in R 4.1.3 and run in RStudio.

## Getting started

  * ' 01_HES_Episode_level_data_prep.r' aggregates hospital episode level data to stay level for each year.
  * ' 02a_HES_patient_characteristics_2015_2019.r' produces patient characteristic information for each calendar year from 2015 to 2019.
  * ' 02b_HES_patient_characteristics_2022.r' produces patient characteristic information for calendar year 2022.
  * ' # 03_Data_for_Graphing.r' produces the figure outputs for the Length of Stay long chart.
